#### Overview

Project 2 will really test your new skills, bringing four weeks of knowledge together to create an app that integrates the technologies and principles we have learned in class, including:

- Data persistance through a SQLite database (CRUD)
- Searching and Filtering
- Testing

**You will be working individually for this project**. The project will be spread across **two weeks**, with separate deliverables due at the end of each week.

#### Requirements

__Your work must:__

- Have [__user stories__](https://github.com/ga-students/ADI_SM_1/tree/master/work/04-week/07-p2-prep/user-stories),  [__paper prototypes__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_prototyping),  and an [__ERD__](http://ga-students.github.io/adi_lesson_slides/04-week/db-intro/slideshow.html#1).
- Used __source control__ as [expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in](https://github.com/ga-students/ADI_SM_1/tree/master/work/04-week/07-p2-prep/git-workflow). 
- Show appropriate use of __comments__, explaining the functionality behind sections of code.
- Be an app that uses a __SQLite__ databse to __store & retrieve__ data locally using technologies and best practices as covered in class 
- __CREATE__ data by __seeding__ the database with meaningful data for use by your app 
- __READ__ data by allowing the user to __search__ by at least three different criteria 
- __Show__ results in separate entries/pages to the user, including descriptions, images, and whatever else you like 
- Include **at least 8** manual test cases in a separate text file & include at least one automated unit test 

__Nice to haves:__

- **Bonus 1**: Allow the user to add __new__ data
- **Bonus 2**: Allow the user to __delete__ data
- **Bonus 3**: Implement __update__ by allowing the user to __favorite__, and later view those favorites 

__Stretch goals:__

- **Bonus**: Create a review system for user feedback at each location (Implement a second model, with relational associations) 
- **Bonus**: Incorporate Material Design principles into your UI 
- **Bonus**: Add more complexity to the user's searches (possibly allowing more than one search criteria at a time)

#### Code of Conduct

As always, your app must adhere to General Assembly's [student code of conduct guidelines](../code-of-conduct.md).

If you have questions about whether or not your work adheres to these guidelines, please speak with a member of your instructional team.

#### Necessary Deliverables

**Week 4:**


- A prototype of your app idea submitted to and signed off by your instructor 
- User Stories
- A github Repo with a readme including all the above
- A **basic version of the user interface**, with placeholder data and resources to fill out your screens.

**Week 5:**

The finished app.

#### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Complete as much of the layout as possible before working on your logic.
- Write pseudocode before you write actual code - thinking through the logic of something helps.
- Test functionality as soon as you complete it.

#### Project Feedback + Evaluation


Base on the requirements you can earn a maximum of 24 points on this project. Your instructors will score each of your technical requirements using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

 This will serve as a helpful overall gauge of whether you met the project goals, but __the more important scores are the individual ones__ above, which can help you identify where to focus your efforts for the next project!
